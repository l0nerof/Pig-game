# Pig Game

Pig Game is a browser-based game where two players take turns rolling a dice with numbers from 1 to 6 to score points. If a player rolls a 1, the turn switches to the other player. The game continues until one player reaches a score of 20. After the game ends, players can start a new game immediately. This project was developed to enhance skills in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, HTML, BEM, and CSS.
